Nxpy.Ccase - WORK IN PROGRESS
=============================

Nxpy.Ccase is a wrapper for the Clear Case ``cleartool`` command line utility that allows the
invocation of Clear Case UCM commands as Python methods.
 
The library is being developed with Python 3.7 so as to be compatible with Python 2.7. Tests are
run also with 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6.

Originally the library was part of the Nxpy project and resided on SourceForge at
<http://nxpy.sourceforge.net>.
