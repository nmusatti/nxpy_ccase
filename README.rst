Nxpy Ccase - WORK IN PROGRESS
=============================

  *This project needs a new maintainer. I only ever managed to test it against a now ancient
  ClearCase 7.1 LT installation, to which I'm likely to lose access in a not too distant future.*

*Nxpy Ccase* is a wrapper for the Clear Case ``cleartool`` command line utility that allows the
invocation of Clear Case UCM commands as Python methods.
 
It is being developed with Python 3.7 so as to be compatible with Python 2.7. Tests are
run also with 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6.

You can install the library from PyPI::

    pip install nxpy-ccase

The library documentation is available on 
`ReadTheDocs <https://nxpy_ccase.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Originally the library was part of the Nxpy project and resided on
`SourceForge <http://nxpy.sourceforge.net>`_.
