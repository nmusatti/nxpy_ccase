Nxpy Ccase
==========

Nxpy Ccase provides a Python wrapper for ``cleartool``, the ClearCase command line utility.


.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   ccase.rst

It is being developed with Python 3.7 so as to be compatible with Python 2.7. Tests are
run also with 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6. It may still work with versions as early as 3.2 and 2.5, but they
are not tested.

Originally the library was part of the Nxpy project and resided on `SourceForge`_.
Starting from release 1.0.0 it is being packaged separately and it is hosted on `GitHub`_.

The Nxpy logo was drawn by Claudia Romano.
